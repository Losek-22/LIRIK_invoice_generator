Invoice generator for Lirik (twitch.tv/lirik) by l8sek
The code is just a fun, quick side project creating a PDF file with a given name, and then using imgur API to upload it and return an image link.

0. place all contents into a single folder
1. install Python (newest one will do), BE SURE TO CHECK "include in PATH" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DURING INSTALLATION
2. in order to use Imgur upload API create a new application in Imgur Account Settings, then copy Client ID and paste it into imgur_client_id
3. launch command prompt in the folder containing invoice.py
4. Type "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install dependencies
5. type "python invoice.py"
6. input the name of invoicee
7. wait and copy the link to the image

Technicalities:
Script reads "form.docx" which you can modify, just don't change the three lines that are modified by the program. It modifies the contents, saves as a new .docx, converts it into .pdf, then into .jpg, and finally uploads to imgur through their API.

popplers folder is required for converting pdf to image, itâ€™ll crash without it
